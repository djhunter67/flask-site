            <p>
                I served eight years in the United States Marine Corps as an infantry machine gunner. In my last four, of the eight, years I served as an Infantry Combat Instructor. I instructed over 1100 entry level Marines on machine guns, machine gun employment, and
                machine gun gunnery. After I exited under an honorable discharged I was emplyed as a Sears auto technician for six months. I left that job to pursue an Electrical Engineering Degree from Arizona State University. Among the focuses pertaining
                to that degree I gravitated toward the programming aspect the most. I am fascinated by compiled and scripted languages. I like the strict typing of java and the duck typing of python. I have previously coded in C/C++ and I find that syntax
                is eerily similar to Java. I have learned how html and, more importantly, html tags are utilized throughout a web page. I understand the manipulation of html using javascript and css. Personally, I like to use Sass to manipulate the css
                that manipulates the html. I have taken a graduate course at NOVA Southeastern on Software Development and learned, heavily, about Agile, Scrum, Test-driven development, and all the small intricate steps required when effectively implementing
                a software develpment plan. Unfortunately, I have already developed and launched this site before I took that course. Therefore, this site has major problems that I am actively working to resolve.

                    I have been studying during every fall, spring, and summer semester for the four and half years I have been attending university. No summers off. I have studied, non-exclusively, Electrical Engineering. Transistor doping, power plants, and machine learning
                    are some of the course work required in the degree plan. I felt it was important to develop myself as a programmer and an engineer. As a result, I have several projects I have worked on to show that I am not just an Electrical Eningeer
                    but also a Computer Science student. I also plan to pursue a Masters Degree in Information Assurance and Cyber Security. My GPA is on a 4.0 scale and sat reguarly at strong
                    <strong>3.0/4.0</strong>. I reguarly recieved excellent marks for my progamming courses but no so much for non S.T.E.M courses.

                    I walked into the recruiters office the summer after high school. I arrived at bootcamp two weeks later. I trained as an Infantry Machine Gunner after bootcamp. Throughout my eight years in the United States Marine Corps I came to into several leadership
                    and instructor positions. A hard learned lesson; in order to be a good leader one has to be a good listener first. I left the Marine Corps after eight years to pursue a degree in S.T.E.M. It was not until a few years in that I discovered
                    the world of software and programming. My time in the Marine Corps has developed my team working and leadership skills exponentially. I accepted an
                    Honorable Discahrge as an <strong>E-5, Sergeant</strong>.
