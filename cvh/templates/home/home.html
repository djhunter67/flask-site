        <p>As a hobby I enjoy coding, building pc's, welding, and routine maintenance on hardware, software, and automobiles. Under coding I am knowledgable in Python, Java, and C/C++. I have employed databases and have written several machine learning scripts.
            My personal computer has <a href="/static/img/7_monitor_setup.jpg" target="_blank">seven monitors</a> which has increased my personal productivity several fold. I enjoy welding for the same reason I enjoy programming. Taking a set of tools
            and creating something, modifying, and/or repairing calls forward a sense of accomplishment worth seeking.
        </p>
        <p>My name is <a href="/about"><strong>Christerpher Hunter</strong></a> and I am an Arizona State University graduate of the Ira. A. Fulton School of Engineering with a Bachelors Degree of Electrical Engineering.
